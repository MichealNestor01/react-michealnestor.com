    "description": "I created a set of utilities for manipulating the GTOPO30 dataset. The GTOPO30 dataset is a 30 arc-second resolution elevation scan of the planet. The most challenging utility was gtopoAssembleReduce.c which reads the entire gtopo30 dataset (27 DEM files)  from disk, assembles it in memory, but does not write it to disk. Instead, it should apply a reduction factor and only write the reduced version to disk. This project was a piece of coursework for \"COMP1921 Programming Project\"",
